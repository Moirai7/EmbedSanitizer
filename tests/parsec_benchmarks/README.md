We describe how to compile and run these benchmarks.

For each benchmarks, three versions of executable are roduced: 
* 32-bit ARM binary without instrumentation
* 32-bit ARM binary with EmbedSanitizer instrumentation for race detection
* 64-bit binary for x86_64 machines, instrumented by ThreadSanitizer
